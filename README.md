# Electric-field Induced Wetting of Nanopores

This repository contains scripts for the analysis of the behaviour of water and ions inside nanopores such as ion channels under the influence of an external electric field. In particular, it comprises:

 * scripts to identify the passage of ions through a pore in a molecular dynamics trajectory
 * scripts to set up and analyse Poisson-Boltzman electrostatics calculation of MD simulation systems
 * scripts to perform Bayesian multilevel modelling of the hydration probability of the pore

Details on the algorithms used can be found in the paper cited above and its supporting information.
